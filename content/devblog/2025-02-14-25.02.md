# Q1 Recap

Its been a while. Despite popular belief, the probject is still trucking along. Albeit a little slower than we would hope. 

# Animation

**Nath** has been working on the animation system, allowing for different items to be held, different poses (Sitting, crouching), interaction with tools, as well as interactions with hands.

While still a WIP, its a big step into getting our little spacemen to behaving more like spacemen.

# Localization

**Ryan** has implemented localization to the game. With support for French, Portugese, and Russian. More languages will be added, but for now its a start to making the game more accessible to non-English speakers. Those willing to assist in broadening the language support for SS3D can join the {{ link(key="discord_url", text="Discord", path="") }} and assist a programmer in getting their language implemented.

# Electricity

**Goru** Integrated the vending machines and jukebox into our electricity system.

# Crafting 

**Nath** Added to the crafting system, now with recipes for building walls.

# Atmospherics

**Nath** Has been working on returning the staple atmos system back into the game, integrating pipes and machinery. You can see it in action below:

## Details
