# Recap

It's been a while. Despite popular belief, the probject is still trucking along. Albeit a little slower than we would hope. We haven't had a blog in many months due minimal progress so we are especially excited to release this.

# What We're Doing

While things may seem dire when it comes to this project, hope has never been lost. Come hell or high water, SS3D will break the curse and become the remake it was destined to be.

As of the airing of this devblog, we are in the process of advertising ourselves and searching for new blood to help build this project. We have a bounty board with money to back it up. If you are a programmer or know someone who wants to earn a few extra buckaroos, [check out our github bounties](https://github.com/RE-SS3D/SS3D/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3ABounty). We will update it as often as possible. Our funds may be limited but we will try to make it worth your while. 

# Localization

**Ryan** has implemented localization to the game. With support for French, Portugese, and Russian. More languages will be added, but for now its a start to making the game more accessible to non-English speakers. Below you can see the system in action, with a fallback if localization isn't included in a specific asset.

</div>

Current translations are made via Google Translate. Those willing to assist in broadening the language support for SS3D can join our {{ link(key="discord_url", text="Discord", path="") }} and assist a programmer in getting their language implemented.

# Electricity

**Goru** integrated the vending machines and jukebox into our electricity system. They both now consume a small amount of electricity while connected to the electrical grid and idling, and consume even more when in use.

# Construction (Crafting)

**Nath** added construction recently. This is not a new system but rather an expansion to the crafting system. And now have construction recipes for walls.

## WIP

We normally don't like to mention WIP content here in our blogs due to the nature of WIP content to begin with. Some of this content may not make it into the game for a long time or even at all...

So, we won't be disclosing specifics, to see those you will have to invade our {{ link(key="discord_url", text="Discord Server", path="") }}. However, we would like to briefly mention they we are currently workingn on the oh-so-important Animaiton & Atmospheric systems. Both of which have been major bottlenecks for this project.

## Footnotes

Despite everything, we appreciate the support you all have given us. Every contributor past and present have been important to the continued life of this project. 

Once again we would like to direct those interested to our [bounty board](https://github.com/RE-SS3D/SS3D/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3ABounty). Please tell your programmer friends about us, any help will always be appreciated.

After that, come hop in our {{ link(key="discord_url", text="Discord", path="") }} to see more frequent updates and chat with the developers!
