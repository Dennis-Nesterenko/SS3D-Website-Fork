### How to contribute:

There are 2 primary ways you can contribute;
- donating to the project, 
- helping with development.

# Donation Links

{{ link(key="patreon_url", text="**Patreon**", path="") }}

{{ link(key="paypal_url", text="**Paypal**", path="") }}

# Development

If you're a programmer, 2D artist, 3D modeler, musician, programmer, animator, soundcloud rapper, or *especially* a programmer, we need you!

**To start on any of these, read the appropriate sections below which contains links to guides and task boards for those contribution types. Once you have a task in mind, contact a council member on our {{ link(key="discord_url", text="Discord", path="") }}.**

The game itself is being developed in the Unity game engine. You can find what version of Unity we use and instructions on setting up our project on our {{ link(key="gitbook_url", text="developer guide", path="/dev-guide/") }}.

Our {{ link(key="github_url", text="GitHub organization", path="") }} has 4 main repositories.
- {{ link(key="github_url", text="SS3D", path="/SS3D") }} - the game itself, and some documents.
- {{ link(key="github_url", text="Art", path="/SS3D-Art") }} - art storage, with source files.
- {{ link(key="github_url", text="Website", path="/SS3D-Website") }} - our (this) website.
- {{ link(key="github_url", text="CentCom", path="/SS3D-CentCom") }} - api which manages user registration, authentication, and character storage.

For any other questions, concerns, or unsolicited advice, just ask around on the discord and someone will likely help you out.

## Coding Tasks:

Start by familiarizing yourself with our {{ link(key="gitbook_url", text="C# style guide", path="/dev-guide/guidelines/the-c-style-guide") }}, and the rest of our {{ link(key="gitbook_url", text="developer guide", path="/dev-guide/") }}.

Feel free to help on any of our 3 repositories as they could all use your help, but since most of you are here to help with the game itself, visit the SS3D {{ link(key="github_url", text="Issues page", path="/SS3D/issues") }} and use the labels to help find a task you are interested in. 

## 3D Modeling Tasks:

Start by downloading our [Modelerâ€™s Kit](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11SMsOzh78-vNTq3Az5c-mUFpFw-5EOb8?usp=share_link) folder, and check out our {{ link(key="gitbook_url", text="3D Art Guide", path="/art-guide/3d") }}.

Then visit our [models board](https://trello.com/b/ZVcDitv0/ss3d-model-list) for general models and the [rig models board](https://trello.com/b/cyDuUYyv/ss3d-rig-models) for models related to rigging (characters, clothes, vehicles, etc.)

We recommend using [Blender](https://www.blender.org/download/releases/) as it's free and open-source, thus it's easily accessible by most people, and as a result our modeler's kit is mostly designed for use with Blender.

## 3D Animation Tasks:

Start by deciding on a task from our [animations board](https://trello.com/b/xZ5bhNWw/ss3d-animations). Then see our {{ link(key="gitbook_url", text="Animation Guide", path="/art-guide/3d/animating") }}.

If it's related to the character rig, we have a [Character Animation Kit](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1V8QAE9651nYJffCSz9zjjygextDHN-GQ?usp=share_link) but it's currently only set up for Maya users, although you can use Blender to animate too.

## 2D Art Tasks:

Visit our [2D board](https://trello.com/b/XVZ95Hjq/ss3d-2d) to find a task to work on and then visit our {{ link(key="gitbook_url", text="2D Art Guide", path="/art-guide/2d") }}.

## Sound Tasks:

We currently do not have any guides for SFX, but if you want to scream like a psychopath or fart into a microphone, check out our [sfx board](https://trello.com/b/k6pWgJE0/ss3d-sound-design).

## Submissions:

Technical contributions are submitted to {{ link(key="github_url", text="our game repo via pull request", path="/SS3D/pulls") }}.

Art contributions currently are submitted via the art channels in our {{ link(key="discord_url", text="Discord", path="") }} server.
